## Introduction

Tetris is one of the most iconic and well-known puzzle games where players aim to arrange falling blocks, or tetrominoes, in a way that creates complete horizontal lines. This project is a classic implementation of Tetris, developed as a final project to showcase game development techniques and logical problem-solving.

## Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay.
- Real-time falling blocks (Tetrominoes).
- Rotation and movement of blocks.
- Scoring system that increases as lines are cleared.
- Game over detection and restart functionality.
- [Any additional features you have implemented, e.g., high score tracking, sound effects, etc.]

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: [Specify programming language, e.g., Java, Python, C++]
- **Framework/Engine**: [If any game development framework or engine was used]
- **Libraries**: [List any external libraries used]

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: The game begins with a tetromino falling from the top of the screen.
2. **Move the Blocks**: You can move the blocks left or right and rotate them to fit them together.
3. **Clear Lines**: Complete horizontal lines to score points. The more lines you clear, the higher your score.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends when the blocks stack up to the top of the screen.

### Controls:
- **Left Arrow**: Move tetromino left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move tetromino right.
- **Up Arrow**: Rotate tetromino.
- **Down Arrow**: Speed up tetromino's fall.
